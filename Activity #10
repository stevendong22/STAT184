#Read csv file
tortilla_data <- read_csv("tortilla_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
#Calculate average price in 2007
avg_price_2007 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  summarize(Average_Price_2007 = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
avg_price_2007

# A tibble: 1 × 1
  Average_Price_2007
               <dbl>

###b) For the year 2024, find the average price of tortillas across all of these 6 states together.

#Calculate average price in 2024
avg_price_2024 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2024) %>%
  summarize(Average_Price_2024 = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
avg_price_2024

# A tibble: 1 × 1
  Average_Price_2024
               <dbl>
1               20.5
###c) Find the percent change in the average price of tortillas across all six states together from the year 2007 to 2024.

#calculates the percent change
percent_change <- ((avg_price_2024$Average_Price_2024 - avg_price_2007$Average_Price_2007) / avg_price_2007$Average_Price_2007) * 100
percent_change

###d) Make a plot that shows the average price of tortillas (across all six states together) each year from the years 2007 to 2024. Add an appropriate title for this figure using Quarto.

#calculate the average price for each year from 2007 to 2024
avg_price_each_year <- tortilla_data %>%
  #filter for years 2007 to 2024
  filter(year >= 2007 & year <= 2024) %>%  
  #group by year
  group_by(year) %>%  
  #calculate the mean price for each year
  summarize(Average_Price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))  

#create plot
ggplot(avg_price_each_year, aes(x = year, y = Average_Price)) +
  #line plot for average price
  geom_line() + 
  #points for each year
  geom_point() +  
  labs(
    #title
    title = "Average Price of Tortillas Across All Six States (2007-2024)",  
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Price"
  )



###e) For the year 2016, provide summary statistics for each of the six states’ price of tortillas. Make a table of the average price of tortillas in each state in 2016. Add a title for this table using Quarto. Also make side-by-side boxplots for each state in 2016. Add an appropriate title and caption for this figure using Quarto.

#gets data from 2016
data_2016 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2016)
#summary stats in 2016
summary_2016 <- data_2016 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(
    Average_Price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min_Price = min(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

5 Sonora                  13.5         10.3      9.93      19       3.71
6 Tamaulipas              13.3         11.5     10.5       16       2.17
#create and display the boxplots for each state in 2016
ggplot(data_2016, aes(x = state, y = price, fill = state)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplots of Tortilla Prices by State in 2016",
    x = "State",
    y = "Price of Tortillas",
    caption = "Boxplot represents the distribution of tortilla prices in 2016 for each state."
  ) +
  #makes it so the labels aren't bunched up
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))



###f) For the state of Nuevo León, make an overlapping plot of the price of tortillas each year from 2007 to 2024 based on store type (i.e., small businesses vs. large corporations). Comment on your findings. Add an appropriate title and caption for this figure using Quarto.

#filter Nuevo León
nuevoleon_data <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(state == "NuevoLeon", year >= 2007 & year <= 2024)

#create the overlapping plot
ggplot(nuevoleon_data, aes(x = year, y = price, color = storeType)) +
  #line plot
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Tortilla Prices in Nuevo León (2007–2024) by Store Type",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Price of Tortillas",
    color = "Store Type",
    caption = "Data shows yearly tortilla price trends for small businesses and large corporations."
  )



###g) Include a picture of a tortilla. Add a caption in which you cite the source from which the picture originated. https://www.seriouseats.com/flour-tortillas-northern-mexico
